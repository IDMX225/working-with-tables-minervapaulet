          On May 22, 1960, struck a powerful earthquake.
          It caused localized tsunamis with waves up to 25 meters (82 feet) high, 
          severely damaging the Chilean coast, especially Valdivia. It resulted 
          in approximately 1,655 deaths, 3,000 injuries, and 2,000,000 people left homeless.
